Code for LCD and conductivity probe to calculate salinity

Archived since the competition season is over


## I/O

Input: Analog voltage readout from probe - 1000 Ohmn

(the 1000 Ohmn can be modified to offset extra resistance from the wires)

(Hold input button to detect, LED will be on if something is detected)

Output: On LCD screen, Resistance and Conductivity
